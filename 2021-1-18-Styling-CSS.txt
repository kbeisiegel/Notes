<div style="color:blue; border: 1px dashed currentcolor;">
  The color of this text is blue.
    <div style="background:currentcolor; height:9px;"></div>
    This block is surrounded by a blue border.
    </div>

Descendant combinator to style things based on location
(<em> element within <li>)
li em {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

Adjacent sibling combinator
(<p> after heading)
h1 + p {
  font-size: 200%;
}

Styling links target <a> (anchor) element

a:link {
  color: pink;
}

a:visited {
  color: green;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* selects any <span> that is inside a <p>, which is inside an <article> */
article p span { ... }

/* selects any <p> that comes directly after a <ul>, which comes directly after a <h1> */
h1 + ul + p { ... }

body h1 + p .special {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 5px;
}

Linking the CSS file
<!-- Inside a subdirectory called styles inside the current directory -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">

<!-- Inside a subdirectory called general, which is in a subdirectory called styles, inside the current directory -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/general/style.css">

<!-- Go up one directory level, then inside a subdirectory called styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css">

Using <style> element within the HTML <head> would result in an internal stylesheet

inherit is a value that takes from a previous value
initial is a value that resets the property to its initial value
unset is a value that that resets the property to its natural value

The higher specificity of rule/selector, the higher the priority

h1 { } (targets element)

.box { } (targets class)

#unique { } (targets specific ID)

* is the universal selector
